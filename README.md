## What is FinAcNews?
FinAcNews is a Python-based tool designed to fetch academic articles from a curated selection of reputable websites covering the FinTech sector. 
<br />
It automatically parses RSS feeds, filters the results using customisable keywords, and distils each article into a concise, plain-English summary, making complex research more accessible at a glance. Each summary comes with a link to access the full article online.
<br />
Users can tailor the script to define how far back in time it should search, which keywords trigger inclusion, and whether to display direct links to the original sources.
